Warsaw is the city to be visted the most

Car is prefered 

Cultural aspects is a big one

Did all survey questions you developed in this lab provide you with
information you could use to design your product? (Note: finding out that
a user wasnâ€™t interested in a feature is still very useful).

Yes as i have got other peoples input on if they know what poland is and if they want to go.   
I think if more time was allocated i could think of better questions as the currents ones werent as best quality,
the survey couldve been way better in presentation as it looked really scuffed but improvements can be easily put into 
the current and future ones. There were a few suprises within the responses as many people had decided to go by car instead of 
plane which was very suprising. I should get some more input with the other questions. I think from this form i can see that 
people would go to Poland for their cultural and holidays aspects
