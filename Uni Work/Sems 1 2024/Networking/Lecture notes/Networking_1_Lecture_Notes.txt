20/2 - Network Models and Intro to Wireless Tech 
	Rules in communication
		Human communication protocols require 
		Identified sender and Reciever 
		Common language and grammar 
		Speed and timing of delivery 
		Confrimation of Acknowledgement requirements 


	Computer network protocols are similar. It requires:
		Messgae encoding 
		messgae formatting and encapsulation 
		message size 
		message timing 
		message delivery options


	Encoding: Converting info into another acceptable form for transmission 
	Decoding: Reverses the process in orsder to interpret the information (happens at the receiving end)

	Encapsulation: placing one message format inside another message format
	De-encapsulation: similar to when the recipient removes the letter from the envelope 

	OSI X TCP/IP MODELS 

	OSI and TCP/IP models describe the network communications 
	The OSI and TCP/IP protocol suites where developed around the same time, and both of them have a model to 
	describe the network communication 

	OSI has 7 Layers which describe a specfic aspect of networking communication 
	OSI is primarly used because of detail it provides 

	TCP/IP is fabric of networks as the internet has become a key part of orgs 

	TCP/IP has 4 Layers

	In OSI model transmitting hosts passesd data from layer 7 (Application Layer) to Layer 1 (Physical)

	Encapsulaiton happens when data travels from application layer to physical layer, when data is sent from a device 

	It then passes over the comms channel to the destination host where the data proceeds back from layer 1 to layer 7 

	De-encapsulation happens when data travels from phys layer to app layer. e.b when data is received at device 

	To foware a packet, each device will remove the old address of the last sending and recieveing devices and replaced these with its own address and the address of the next device which needs to receieve ther packet 
	this is called de-encapsulation and the opposite process in encapsulation 

	Once packet is there it is de-encapsilated and placed in the correct order so the host can reassemble the segments allowing for reconstruction 

	
	Steps of Data Transmission

		Data Creation:
		Application layer of the sending device handles encoding, compression, and encryption if necessary.
		
		Transmission to Transport Layer:
		Processed data is sent as a stream to the transport layer.
		
		Segmentation:
		Sending host breaks data into small segments for efficient simultaneous transmission.
		
		Packetization:
		Segments are addressed with source and destination internet addresses, forming packets.
		
		Addressing with MAC/Physical Addresses:
		Packets are addressed with MAC or Physical Addresses, becoming frames.
		
		Frame Encoding:
		Network access layer prepares frames with source and destination addresses.
		
		Bit Encoding:
		Frames are encoded into bits.
		
		Transmission Medium:
		Bit stream is converted to electrical pulses, light flashes, or radio waves.
		
		Network Media Transmission:
		Converted signals are sent across the network media for transmission

WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY
	Intro to Wireless LAN Networking 

	An ever-expanding x Improving tech 

	Standardized by the 802.11 family of protocols 

	A WLAN is not a cellular phone network and doesnt provide packet data transmission for phones 

	Infared, a type of wireless that cannot penetrate through walls due to low energy 

	WIRELESS MEDIA 

	Carry electromagnetuc signals that represent the binary digits of data communications using radio or microwaves 
	arent restricted to conductors or pathways 
	provide the greatest mobility options of all media 
	are popular in home and business networks 

	CONNECTING TO NETWORK 
	Many homes use a combination of a wired, wireless switch and router called a integrated service router (ISR) 
	With wireless devices, data is transmitted using radio waves 
	A wireless network MUST incorportate a wireless access point (WAP) for devices to connect to 

	BENEFITS OF WIRELESS 

	Mobility, Scalability, Flexibility, cost savings, Installation time and Reliability in harsh 
	enviorments 

	LIMITIATIONS 

	Wireless LANS (WLAN) use unlicensed regions of RF spectrum 
	Can be congested and easily interfered with one another e.g microwaves and cordless phones 
	Major concern: Security 

	Factors influencing of radio waves:
	 Reflection - occurs when rf waves bounce off objects 
	 scattering - occurs when RF waves strike an uneven surface 
	 Absorption - RF waves asorbed by Objects 

	WLAN COMPONETS (Image) - https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1212554806871461919/1212575977251672104/image.png?ex=65f25661&is=65dfe161&hm=3ccadafcee09d8389edf5f28b6630de8ddad36cab5ae7856aaeea67df3527b9d&


	Wireless Channel (image)- https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1212554806871461919/1212576561488986213/image.png?ex=65f256ec&is=65dfe1ec&hm=e38b425481c0b6f52e1466caf93b9889cff4715c4a8c3e212a50ae53c52445c2&
	

	The choice of channel for an AP must be made relative to the other wlans around it 
	Adjacent BSS must non overlapping channels in order to optimized throughput 

	APS x ISRS now offer a choice to configure the channel or allow the AP to auto located the least 
	congested channel or maximum throughput 


	SSID - Service Set IDentifier 
	Important that wireless devices connect to the correct WLAN which is achived via a SSID

	SSID is case-senstitve, alpha numeric, up to 32 characters. Sent in header if all frames transmitted over wlan. tells wireless devices WLAN they belong to 

	All devices sharing a WLAN must have the same SSID in order to communicate 


	ANTENNA KEY TERMS 
	Directionality: coverage around antenna. Omnidirectional WLAN antenna transmits/receives signals in all horizontal directions equally. A directional antenna focuses the signal from the AP into a smaller coverage area, resulting in a stronger signal in this direction. 

	Gain: The amount of increase in energy that an antenna appears to add to an RF signal. 

	Polarization: Physical orientation (vertical or horizontal) of the element on the antenna that emits the RF energy. 

	AUTHENTICATION X ASSOCIATION

	Authentication - the client must successfully pass auth before it assoicte with the AP 

	If both auth and MAC address filtering are enabled, auth is first 

	with successful auth AP will then check the MAC address agaisnts its own MAC adress table. one verfierd the AP adds the host MAC address into the host table 

	The client is then said to be associated with the AP and can connect 


	WLAN ENCRYPTION
	Auth x MAC filtering may stop an attacker from connecting to a wireless network but it will NOT prevent them intercepting transmitted sata 

	Since there are no distinct boundaries and all traffic is transmitted thru the air, it is easy for an attack to intercept, or sniff the wireless frames. Encryption is the process of transforing data so that even if its it intercepted it is unusable 

	WEP (wireless Equivalent Privacy) used to be a great way to prevent attackers from getting data. But the use of static keys on WEP devices were a weakness 

	Apps can be used to discoveer them and once they have access to all transmitted data 

	WPA is a stronger version 

	PSK (Pre shared Keys)

	The Access Point (AP) and client share the same key or secret word.
	The AP sends a random string to the client, which encrypts it based on the shared key and sends it back.
	The AP decrypts the received string and authenticates the client if it matches the original string.
	PSK performs one-way authentication, where the client authenticates to the AP.
	The AP is not authenticated to the client, and the actual user's identity is not verified.








27/2 IPV4 ADDRESSING 
	
	IP Address 
	An IP address is a identifier for a device on a TCP/IP network

	IP addresses allow a device to reach another one to couumincate and exchange data within a intranet or 
	the internet 

	IPv4 and IPv6 are the most common 

	Both must have uniquely identification 
	IP can be Dynamic (DHCP) or static (Manual by Admin)
	IPS use binary since hosts, servers and network devices can only read and understand IP addresses in bunary formatting 

	Binary is a numbering system, 1 and 0's are bits, a byte is 8 

	We read them as decimal numbers but computers read them in binary 

	Binary numbering system each number represents increasing powers of 2 
	Base 2 only has two digits 1 x 0 
	in 8 bit: 2^7 = 128
			  2^6 = 64
			  2^5 = 32
			  2^4 = 16 
			  2^3 = 8 
			  2^2 = 4 
			  2^1 = 2 
			  2^0 = 1 
	0-9 are base numbers 

	When we interpret a byte as a decimal, we add the quantity which that position represents if the digit is a 1. We do not add that quantit if the digit is a 0 

	Example: 111111112 = 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 25510
		     110000002 = 128 + 64 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 19210

	INTERNET ADDRESSES 
		Each deviced on a network must be uniquel identifed using IPv4 or IPv6 binary
		IPV4 networks use a string of 32 bits 
		Each packet includes a source and destination IP 
		We represent 32 IPv4 in dotted decimals (2.1.1.1) as a group of 4 decimal numbers, one muber for each 8 bit (Example, it is more easy for us to remember as 2.1.1.1 than the 4 byte address 00000010.00000001.00000001.00000001)
		Left most bye is often called the first octet and the remaining bytes are the second to the fourth octet on the right 

	NETWORKING V HOST IN IP
		all IPV4 have 32 bits of binary 
		Network portion is the first 3 decimals and the last one is the host 
		192.57.30 (network).224 (host)

		Routers use the network part for forwarding packets 
		Host part is used for LANS to find hosts 

	Recognize the Network and Host 
		IPV4 Classes 

		(1-127) Class A = N.H.H.H
					Mask= 255.0.0.0
		(128-191) Class B = N.N.H.H
					Mask= 255.255.0.0
		(192-223) Class C = N.N.N.H 
					Mask = 255.255.255.0




		Class A: first tells us the network number and which belong to the host 
		only can be between 0-127 and the first number is a network number 
		Class A adresses are often called a slash 8 class because of the 8 bits for the network 
		e.g Apple has 17.149.160.49

		127.0.0.1 is a loopback address which is used for troubleshooting a local NIC


		Class B and C: 
		
		Class B
		First Byte is between 128 and 191 and then the first two belong to the network number 

		An address like this is a class B aka slash 16 because of the 8 bits for the network 
		UCLA has the ip 169.232.55.224 (169 = class b since between 128 - 191)


		Class C
		192 - 223 and the first 3 numbers belong to the network 
		Seen as slash 24 
		Yahoo.com has ip 209.131.36.158
		class c since 209 is between 192 ansd 223 




		IPS always have a mask?

		An Ip Addres is always coupled with a subnet mask and tells a networked deviced which network it belings to 
		Subnet masks signifies which part of the IP address is network and which is a host 
		Seperate field to an IP address 

		Example: 172.16.0.0 is class B with a subnet it is 255.255.0.0

		Class Strructures A - E

		32 bit subnet mask and Router operation

		The router relies on the subnet mask to identify the network to which a host belongs.
		
		It maintains a list (routing table) of masks it has learned to determine the appropriate network for forwarding packets.
		
		The router, when receiving a packet, starts with the largest mask in its routing table and performs an AND operation with the packet's IP address.
		
		If a match is found, the router forwards the packet through the corresponding interface toward the destination network.
		
		If no match is found, the router iteratively performs AND operations with smaller masks until a match is identified.
		
		In the absence of a matching network, the router typically sends the packet to a default network.
		
		If no match is found and no default route is specified, the router discards the packet.


		ANDing 

		Rules   1 and 1 = 1 
				0 and 1 = 0
				0 and 0 = 0 
				1 and 0 = 0 
		Example - Logical (Boolean) AND operation:
		Now, if we AND the two binary numbers together, things go like this:
		0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
		1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
		0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 ANDed!!





		Identify the Networking Portion 
		Diagram https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1212554806871461919/1212596606428254289/image.png?ex=65f26997&is=65dff497&hm=7a057ce6cb37345af1656d93c944bec17eed57b0de43b8c6b991261c602128a8&



		Subnet mask is compared to IPv4 bit for bit, left to right 
		1s identify the network portion and the 0's identify the host 
		Subnet mask actually tells the deviced where to look to identify the network by ANDing 

		A packet has a destination IP as: 192 . 168 . 10 . 10
		In binary form this is: 11000000 10100000 00001010 00001010
		In its routing table, the router has the mask stored as:
		255 . 255 . 255 . 0
		In binary form this is: 11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000
		The router applies bitwise ANDing to corresponding bits of IP and Mask:
		1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 . 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 . 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 . 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
		AND 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 . 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 . 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 . 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
		__________________________________________________
		The result in binary: 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 . 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 . 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 . 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
		In dotted decimal: 192 . 168 . 10 . 0
		So the network address is: 192.168.10.0



		Prefix = Network bits = numbers of 1s in the mask 
		Diagram: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1212554806871461919/1212597558111764480/image.png?ex=65f26a7a&is=65dff57a&hm=65147d452f27a8fd4206fce1f34a19e7bb04245cf2d430fc8a5146b9e5d5e8d0&

		Alternate shorter method of identifying a subnet mask is called a prefix length (CIDR in mask)


		Calculate number of Hosts 
		To calculate the number of host addresses in a network, you can follow these steps using the example of the 192.168.10.0/24 network:

		1. Convert the subnet mask /24 (255.255.255.0) into binary: 11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000.

		2. Identify the number of host bits by counting the number of 0s in the binary mask, which is 8 in this case.

		3. Calculate the number of available hosts using the formula: 2^(number of host bits) - 2.
		   - In this example: 2^8 - 2 = 256 - 2 = 254.

		4. Therefore, in the 192.168.10.0/24 network, you can connect 254 hosts.

		Summary: For the network 192.168.10.0/24, there are 254 available host addresses, as determined by the number of host bits in the subnet mask. All hosts within this network share the same subnet mask, 255.255.255.0 (/24).

		In IPv4 networks, the concepts of network, host, and broadcast addresses are essential:

		- Network Address:
		  - A standard way to refer to a network.
		  - Examples: 192.1.1.0 network, 192.1.1.0 255.255.255.0 network, or 192.1.1.0/24 network.
		  - All hosts in the 192.1.1.0/24 network share the same network portion bits (192.1.1. ...).

		- Host Addresses:
		  - All values between the network address and the broadcast address.
		  - Assignable to end devices in the network.
		  - Example range in the 192.1.1.0/24 network: 192.1.1.1 – 192.1.1.254.

		- Broadcast Address:
		  - The last address in the network (192.1.1.255).
		  - Used to send data to all hosts in a network simultaneously.
		  - Utilizes the highest (last) address in the network range.
		  - Has bits in the host portion set to all 1s.

		  Types of Addresses: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1212554806871461919/1212598779640025128/image.png?ex=65f26b9e&is=65dff69e&hm=5287b320df45f4ed180eb391d3da43c28ca86be47f5aa3a1564eb83db598bd03&




		  Network Address Translation (NAT) is a process used in networking to translate private and public IP addresses. 

			There are various types of IP addresses, including public and private, static and dynamic, among others.

			- Public Addresses:
			  - Intended for hosts that are publicly accessible from the Internet.
			  - Unique addresses to identify devices on the global Internet.
			  
			- Private Addresses:
			  - Can be reused in different private networks.
			  - Packets using private addresses are not directly routed on the public Internet.
			  
			- NAT (Network Address Translation):
			  - Stands for Network Address Translation.
			  - The router or firewall device at the perimeter of private networks must either block or translate (NAT) private addresses.




			  Priavte Address Ranges:
			  Private addresses are nout routable 
			  Internet must be translater into public ipv4 addresses 

			  Often used internally and ONLY locally significant. NOT ALLOWED ON THE INTERNET 
			  Specifically, the blocks are: 

			    A 10.0.0.0 /8 or 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
				B 172.16 .0.0 /12 or 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
				C 192.168 .0.0/16 or 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255




			IPV4 Comms: A host successfully connetced to a network can communicate with other devices in one of three ways 

			1. Unicast - Process of sending a packet from one host to an individual
